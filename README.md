# Multi-Cluster Deployment with ArgoCD

This repository provides a guide on deploying applications onto multiple Kubernetes clusters simultaneously using ArgoCD.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up multi-cluster deployment with ArgoCD, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Cloud Provider Access**:
   - Access to a cloud provider like AWS to provision Kubernetes clusters. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and manage clusters in the desired region (e.g., us-east-1).

2. **Terraform for EKS Cluster Creation**:
   - Use Terraform to automate the creation of EKS clusters. Write Terraform scripts to provision the hub cluster and spoke clusters on AWS.

3. **Kubernetes Clusters**:
   - Ensure you have multiple Kubernetes clusters set up. Access to multiple Kubernetes clusters, including a hub cluster (centralized cluster) and one or more spoke clusters (target clusters).

4. **Network Configuration**:
   - Configure network settings to allow communication between the clusters. This may involve setting up Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), security groups, and ensuring proper firewall rules.

5. **Security Group Configuration**:
   - Adjust security group settings to allow access to ArgoCD UI and API endpoints. Ensure that the necessary ports are open for inbound traffic.

6. **Git Repository**:
   - Prepare a Git repository to store application manifests and configurations. ArgoCD will synchronize with this repository to deploy applications to the target clusters.

7. **Kubernetes Knowledge**:
   - Familiarize yourself with basic Kubernetes concepts such as pods, deployments, services, and namespaces. This knowledge is essential for configuring and managing applications using ArgoCD.

8. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - Install and configure the necessary command-line interface tools such as kubectl to interact with Kubernetes clusters. If using Amazon EKS, ensure you have eksctl installed.

9. **Introduction to ArgoCD and GitOps**:
   - Understand the drawbacks of traditional CI/CD pipelines and the benefits of GitOps principles using tools like ArgoCD for continuous deployment.
   - Differentiate between the hub-spoke model and the standalone model for ArgoCD deployment, considering centralized vs. distributed management of clusters.

10. **Resource Allocation**:
    - Ensure that your Kubernetes clusters have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage) to run ArgoCD and your applications. Adjust resource allocations based on your application requirements and cluster size.
